the brand is Colgate ToothPaste

Notes from class:
promotions are suspected to not be very effective as toothpaste is not a very interesting decision to consumers
as such, most consumers just buy whatever their doctor recommends, or out of habit. Not many people look to 'experiment' with toothpaste brands.
Aspects of marketing that DO impact consumers are practical aspects, such as good for teeth health, teeth whitener
64% of consumers make their toothpaste decision while in the store, 36% make it before entering the store
25% are effected by price
