The Morrison Company
“Let’s meet tomorrow for breakfast to discuss your sense of what’s gone wrong and how we can
fix it.” CEO Jason Robbins’s request echoed in Shauna Breen’s mind as she sat down at her desk to
gather her thoughts. It was the end of her first day as The Morrison Company’s new Director of
Operations. Morrison developed and manufactured radio frequency identification (RFID) tags
known as smart labels for the retail and pharmaceutical industries. The company’s sales had boomed
over the past year, and production levels had increased dramatically to meet monthly and quarterly
shipping targets.
