In February 2016, the president of the Union Pearson Express was being pressured to lower the fare price. The rail link between Union Station in downtown Toronto and the Toronto Pearson International Airport had only been running for eight months, but ridership was well below targets. On average, the train ran at only 10% of capacity, and current revenue only covered 35% of operating costs. The president and her team had set the one-way fare price at CA$27.50 to reflect the high-value positioning of the train. However, this price had received a great deal of criticism. The president had attempted to combat the criticism both in the press and with marketing actions, blaming entrenched consumer behaviours regarding travel. She also offered discounts and promotions to boost ridership, which ultimately failed. Now she had to decide whether to lower fares and how to market the Union Pearson Express.
Ridership was down 2,5000 passengers per day, consumer opinion was down, by early feb, more than half of the year after the launch, opinion was farther negative. metro announced allowing family day to be free for all riders to boost perception. rider satisfaction was high, soon after, perception went back down. this was a huge issue of pricing
one customer said people dont want to walk that far from their condos to the downtown area to ride the metro
